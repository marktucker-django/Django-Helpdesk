A new flag was added to the 'IgnoreEmail' model to allow emails from ignored
addresses to be either kept in the mailbox (for manual checking) or deleted.

A new column called 'keep_in_mailbox' (type boolean, not required) is to be 
added to the 'helpdesk_ignoreemail' table. The 'UPDATE' command will set all 
ignore list entries to 'Keep mail from ignored address', which is the previous
behaviour.

    ALTER TABLE helpdesk_ignoreemail ADD "keep_in_mailbox" boolean;
    UPDATE helpdesk_ignoreemail SET keep_in_mailbox='t';

#########################

A new field was added to the EmailTemplate entity to allow us to have templates
for multiple languages.

To migrate your database, execute commands similar to the following:

    ALTER TABLE helpdesk_emailtemplate ADD "locale" varchar(10);
    UPDATE helpdesk_emailtemplate SET locale="en";
